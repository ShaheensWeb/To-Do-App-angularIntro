# To Do list, a basic angularApp
Serving as similar to a hello world application in many other languages a to-do application <br/>
is often viewed as the equivalent for angular. For that reason I went ahead and whipped one up quickly <br/>
just to see if I could make one without referencing an API/tutorial. Overall, it went well! <br/>
